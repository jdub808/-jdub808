The Profile
# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm J.W. Adams

## About Me
I'm currently working at the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality, where I've designed Microsoft Power Automations to streamline our email communications. I have a rich history with technology, from studying C++ in high school to building websites, DNS servers, and mail servers. Now, I'm on a journey to become a better programmer and I'm using GitHub as my platform for growth.

## What I'm Learning
I'm currently diving into PHP and SQLite, focusing on developing small business apps for those with little to no technology experience. I believe in making technology accessible and useful for everyone.

## Past Experience
Over the years, I've built websites for various organizations and set up dedicated DNS servers, host servers, and mail servers. This was all before the internet was brimming with information - a true testament to my problem-solving skills and determination.

## Fun Facts
When I'm not coding or learning something new, I love spending time with my kids. We play games like UNO, Minecraft, and Fortnite, and enjoy walks through the green spaces in our neighborhood.

## Let's Connect
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, want to collaborate, or simply want to say hi! I'm always open to making new connections and working on interesting projects.
